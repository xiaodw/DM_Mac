## What Is DevMate

[DevMate](http://devmate.com) is development and distribution platform for OS X developers.

DevMate Dashboard provides a full control over your application and customers, displays app usage statistics, crash reports and user feedback in real time - all from a single, elegant place.

* **Distribute your app**. Upload and host application binaries on DevMate to make the app available for downloading. DevMate uses Amazon CDN to deliver installation files, which guarantees 99.9% uptime.

* **Analyze sales and app usage.** Get detailed sales and downloads reports, conversions ratios and campaign reports. Analyze customers behaviour and application usage.

* **Monitor crash reports.** Issue and exception reports are collected in real time and grouped by similarity in DevMate DashBoard. Each issue group shows the impact on your app users.

* **Manage customers.** A simple CRM crafted specially for the developers and support guys. It collects and stores all essential info about customer and initiated purchases: order number, activation keys, and more.

* **Users’ feedback.** Collect and reply users’ feedback, discuss them with your team, and assign statuses to ensure that no message is left without a reply.

In order to connect your application to DevMate you are to integrate DevMateKit which provides you a set of ready-to-use tools that allows you to prepare your application for distribution:

* **Activations** to protect and license your application. Create time and/or feature limited trial versions.

* **Updates based on Sparkle framework.** Automatically deliver app updates right to the customer.

* **Crash reporting in real time.** DevMate collects and symbolicates issue reports.

* **Feedback.** Your customers can send feedback right from the app.

## Get Started

1\.  Drag and drop **DevMateKit** folder to your project. Check the '_Copy items if needed_' in the dialogue appeared; check '_Create groups_' control for '_Added folders_' group; check your project target in _'Add to targets'_ table.

#### What's Inside

* `DevMateKit.framework` — DevMateKit iteslf.

2\.  Add the framework to build phases of your project:
  1.  Select your project in the Project Navigator.
  2.  Select your application target.
  3.  Select the _'Build Phases'_ tab.
  4.  Copy **DevMateKit.framework** from the Project Navigator to the '_Link Binary With Libraries_' build phase list if it is absent.
  5.  Select _'Editor' > 'Add Build Phase' > 'Add Copy Files Build Phase_' Xcode main menu item.
  6.  Open the newly appeared _'Copy Files_' expander.
  7.  Select '_Frameworks_' in the Destination menu.
  8.  Copy **DevMateKit.framework** from the Project Navigator to the** '**_Copy Files_' list.


3\.  Proceed to the '_Build Settings_' tab. Select '_All_' instead of '_Basic_' set of settings, find '_Runpath Search Paths_' in the list and add the following line if it is absent:

````
@executable_path/../Frameworks
````

4\.  Proceed to the *'Build Settings'* tab and add the following string to the *'Framework Search Paths'*:

````
"$(PROJECT_DIR)/DevMateKit/DevMateKit.framework/Frameworks"
````
if DevMateKit folder is located in the project root folder or
````
"$(PROJECT_DIR)/<Path_to_DevMateKit_folder>/DevMateKit.framework/Frameworks"
````
otherwise.

5\. For Swift project create bridging header and add its path to *'Objective-C Bridging Header'* build setting of your target if it is absent.

### Test Integration

1\.  Add the following string to the import section of your application Objective-C delegate class file or to the special bridging header of your Swift target:

````objective-c
#import <DevMateKit/DevMateKit.h>
````

2\.  Copy and paste the following code to the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method of your application delegate class:

````objective-c
[DevMateKit sendTrackingReport:nil delegate:nil];
````

For Swift projects:

````Swift
DevMateKit.sendTrackingReport(nil, delegate: nil)
````

After you build and run your application, it will start sending launch reports to DevMate.

You can read more on DevMateKit customization in wiki article.

### CocoaPods Integration

You can integrate DevMateKit into your project using [CocoaPods](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DevMateKit/). Here is the podfile:

````ruby
platform :osx, '10.7'
pod 'DevMateKit'
````

## Activations and Trial

To manage activations and trial you need to have Kevlar library installed which is generated uniquely for each application. You can read more on it [here](http://docs.devmate.com/v1.0/docs/activations-and-trial).

## Issue Reporter Setup

DevMateKit allows sending crashes and exception reports that can be viewed later in [Issues Management](http://docs.devmate.com/v1.0/docs/issues-management) section of DevMate Dashboard. Moreover, you will be able to view how issues of your app are distributed by various parameters in [Issues Statistics](http://docs.devmate.com/v1.0/docs/issues-statistics) section, which will help you to detrmine the weaker places of the app.

Enabling issue reporter is that easy as just adding to the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` method of your application delegate class the following.

For Objective-C projects:

````objective-c
[DevMateKit setupIssuesController:nil reportingUnhandledIssues:YES];
````

For Swift projects:

````Swift
DevMateKit.setupIssuesController(nil, reportingUnhandledIssues: true)
````

More info of issue reporter usage you can find in the [wiki article](https://github.com/DevMate/DevMateKit/wiki/Issue-Reporter).

## Feedback Setup

To allow your users sending feedback messages you need to do the following:

1\. Add the following method to your application delegate class implementation:

````objective-c
- (IBAction)showFeedbackDialog:(id)sender {
    [DevMateKit showFeedbackDialog:nil inMode:DMFeedbackIndependentMode];
}
````

For Swift projects:

````Swift
@IBAction func showFeedbackDialog(sender: AnyObject?)  {
    DevMateKit.showFeedbackDialog(nil, inMode: DMFeedbackMode.IndependentMode)
}
````

2\.  Connect action method you just added with corresponding menu item or button inside your XIB files.

3\. Build and run your application. Send a feedback message as you defined in previous step. If everything was done correctly, your message will be displayed in [Feedback Management](http://docs.devmate.com/v1.0/docs/feedback-management) DevMate section.

You can learn more on feedback setup and configuration in [wiki article](https://github.com/DevMate/DevMateKit/wiki/Feedback).

## Updates Setup

To keep user of your app updated, do the following.

1. Add new Object component from _'Object library'_ to your main XIB file and change its class name to `SUUpdater`.
2. Connect `checkForUpdates` action of the `SUUpdater` object which was created in previous step with the corresponding menu item or button inside the XIB files. 
3. Build and run your application and try to update.

Refer to [wiki article](https://github.com/DevMate/DevMateKit/wiki/Updates) if you need more help.
